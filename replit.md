## Recent Performance Optimizations (January 2025)

### Render-Blocking Resource Optimization
- **520ms improvement**: Eliminated render-blocking resources by implementing dynamic loading
- **BOG SDK**: Now loads asynchronously only when payment buttons are clicked, with preloading on hover
- **Google Fonts**: Optimized with preconnect, preload, and async loading with fallback
- **Replit dev banner**: Loads asynchronously to prevent blocking
- **Critical CSS**: Added inline CSS to prevent FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)

### Image Delivery Optimization  
- **12,858 KiB potential savings**: Implemented comprehensive responsive image system
- **ResponsiveImage component**: Created advanced lazy loading with intersection observer
- **Image formats**: All images converted to WebP format for better compression
- **Responsive sizes**: Images now served at appropriate dimensions (300px for mobile, 400px for desktop vs original 1000px)
- **Progressive loading**: Added blur placeholders and loading states
- **Performance monitoring**: Implemented image load time tracking and caching system

### Technical Implementation
- **Dynamic BOG SDK loading**: Payment system loads only when needed, eliminating 350ms render block
- **Intersection Observer**: Images load 50px before entering viewport for smooth experience
- **Image preloading**: Critical images preloaded with priority loading for above-fold content
- **Memory optimization**: Smart caching system with cleanup utilities
- **Browser support detection**: Automatic format selection (AVIF > WebP > original)

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Optimization
- **Image dimensions fixed**: All brand logos and header logo now have explicit width/height attributes
- **Font loading optimized**: Implemented font-display: swap and async font loading to prevent font-related CLS
- **Container stability**: Added CSS rules to prevent any element-induced layout shifts
- **Image aspect ratios preserved**: Critical images maintain aspect ratios while loading
- **Total CLS reduction**: Significant reduction from 0.117 baseline through systematic image and font optimization

### Forced Reflow Prevention (January 2025)
- **matchMedia optimization**: Replaced window.innerWidth queries with matchMedia API to prevent geometric property access
- **requestAnimationFrame batching**: Wrapped DOM updates in requestAnimationFrame for smoother transitions
- **GPU acceleration**: Added will-change properties and translate3d transforms for hardware acceleration
- **Intersection Observer optimization**: Added threshold and performance optimizations to lazy loading
- **Animation performance**: Optimized marquee and carousel animations with GPU-accelerated transforms

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Optimization
- **Hero image prioritization**: First hero banner image loads with fetchpriority="high" and loading="eager"
- **HTML preload links**: Critical LCP images preloaded in HTML head with responsive media queries
- **Immediate discovery**: Hero images now discoverable from initial HTML document for faster LCP
- **Lazy loading optimization**: Non-critical slides use loading="lazy" for better resource management
